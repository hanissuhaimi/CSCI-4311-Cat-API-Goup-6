Project Explanation

Summary:

This application or feature allows users to interact with a collection of cat images in a structured manner. Users have the option to mark images as favorites, which can later be viewed in a dedicated Favorites section. The functionality includes navigating through images using a "Next Image" button, providing a seamless experience for users to explore, add to favorites, and revisit their favorite cat images.

Objective:

The primary objective of the Cat API Project is to provide a practical example of building a Flutter app that interacts with an external API to retrieve and showcase cat images. The project demonstrates proficiency in the following key areas:

  1. Widget Usage:Utilizing Flutter widgets to design a user interface that displays a list of cat images.

  2. HTTP Library Integration:Incorporating the HTTP library to fetch data from an online API: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1

  3. Page Routing:Implementing page routing to allow users to navigate seamlessly between different sections or pages of the app.

  4. GitHub Repository Management: Creating a GitHub repository to host and version control the project files.

  5. Documentation:Providing clear and concise documentation (README.txt) to guide others on how to compile, run, and configure the project.
