Project Explanation

Summary:
This application or feature allows users to interact with a collection of cat images in a structured manner. Users can click on an image to view detailed information such as breed, age, and description. Additionally, they have the option to mark images as favorites, which can later be viewed in a dedicated Favorites section. The functionality includes navigating through images using a "Next" button, providing a seamless experience for users to explore, view details, add to favorites, and revisit their favorite cat images.

Objective:
The primary objective of the Cat API Project is to provide a practical example of building a Flutter app that interacts with an external API to retrieve and showcase cat images. The project demonstrates proficiency in the following key areas:
Widget Usage:
Utilizing Flutter widgets to design a user interface that displays a list of cat images.
HTTP Library Integration:
Incorporating the HTTP library to fetch data from an online API: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1
Page Routing:
Implementing page routing to allow users to navigate seamlessly between different sections or pages of the app.
GitHub Repository Management:
Creating a GitHub repository to host and version control the project files.
Documentation:
Providing clear and concise documentation (README.txt) to guide others on how to compile, run, and configure the project.

Running Instructions
View Image Details:
Click on the image to open a detailed view.
Information such as cat breed, age, and description will be displayed.
Add to Favorites:
A heart symbol will be displayed to the user as an indicator to add the cat image as a favourite. 
Click on it to save the current image as a favorite.
View Favorite Images:
Navigate to the Favorites section in the UI.
Here, you can see a grid or list of all the images you've marked as favorites.
View Next Image:
After viewing details or adding to favorites, use the "Next" button to cycle to the next image in the sequence.
This allows users to easily explore and interact with multiple cat images.
Repeat the Process:
The user can continue the cycle by repeatedly clicking the "Next" button to view more images, see details, add to favorites, and revisit their favorite images.
